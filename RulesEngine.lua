    Essentially a digital SRD, which can be used to rapidly generate text *AND
    CODE* to represent a ruleset to both humans and computers. An example of this
    would be creating a new player ability using preset strings that describe
    things like duration, recharge intervals, attack and defense, etc in a
    consistent, generic manner that is instantly recognizable the moment you
    read it. This trains the player's brain to parse the information faster.
